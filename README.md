# FoodTruckProject



# Description

I started my project by thinking of how this food truck object would work. I decided to create a story and write it out on paper. I thought I would add the menu to a switch but after working more on my project I realized I was missing the mark. I needed to do a for loop so that the array of trucks could be iterated through created and stored. I prompted the user to input the name, food type, and rating of the truck using a scanner. After the input was entered I stored that information in the correct variable. The trucks were then stored in an array and allocated on the heap to be called on for the second portion of the program. The user could then use the provided menu to list the trucks they input, see the average of their ratings, or see the highest rated truck.

# Lessons Learned

Things I learned during this project were more about where and how the methods created are placed with in the program to run properly. I learned about .getRating for the average and highest rated truck methods. It took me some time to truly understand how the trucks being created and stored were needing to be called to present what the user entered. I learned more about arrays, methods, static and non-static methods and fields. It was quite challenging figuring out how to get the proper average and highest rated truck. The homework assignments have really helped me to understand more about what has been taught through the week.
